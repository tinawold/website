# Senior Web Developer

## About us

VIBBIO is a fast-growing tech startup, located in central Oslo. We’re building a marketplace, where businesses can order video production on-demand, directly from their user account. Our vision is to make smart video accessible, affordable and automatic. We are already working with big clients such as Microsoft, Visma, Aker BioMarine and Orkla

We’re a small team of four building the platform today. We take pride in our work, and aim to provide our customers with a delightful experience. We have the freedom to make our own decisions.

We work closely with our in-house team of video and content producers whose lives we want to make infinitely more enjoyable.

## Who we’re looking for

You have been around the block for a couple of years, probably worked at a couple of different places, and you have experience with a number of different technologies and languages, either from work or play.

You choose technology based on the task you need to accomplish rather than dogmatic beliefs. You enjoy the fast paced world of JavaScript but manage to keep your shiny-object-syndrome in check. You care about design and frontend architecture but most of all, about sound functionality.

You don't have to be an expert in everything but we expect you to be able to research good solutions to the problems we decide to solve.

And most importantly, you love to learn new things, and to dig deep when you're onto something.

## Problems to solve

Video production today consists of lots of repetitive manual tasks, and we strive to automate as much as possible of those. We want to make the planning and ordering process for our customers so smooth that they become fully self-served.

We also need to constantly handle large video files, both when it comes to upload and playback.

At least those are the ones we know about now.

## Stack

We run everything on Google Cloud. The backend is currently written in Java with some Node.js sprinkled in. The frontend is React and Sass.
