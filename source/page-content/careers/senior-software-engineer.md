# Senior Software Engineer

## The role

We are hiring an experienced software engineer to strengthen our product team. You will work on all aspects of VIBBIO’s current product, from infrastructure all the way up the stack to the client, as well as any new ones we decide to explore.

Our office is in central Oslo, in the middle of trendy Grünerløkka, but you are free to work from anywhere you want as long as you are productive and able to communicate with the rest of the team.

All of us are free to choose our own tools to get the job done. We’re running all of our stack on Google Cloud, where we make use of a broad set of the available technologies. You will have the opportunity to work with Cloud Functions, Google App Engine, Google Compute Engine, and many of the available Cloud AI APIs. We do not expect you to already have experience with these technologies, but you should be as excited to learn as we are.

We write code in Javascript, Python, and Java, and we may add other languages where it makes sense. You will have the freedom to research and make the case where you see the opportunity.

We believe that diversity, creativity and curiosity is what drives us towards innovation, not the things we already know today. If that is your jam, we want to hear from you.

Send your cover letter, CV and some code samples to [jobs@vibbio.com](mailto:jobs@vibbio.com).
