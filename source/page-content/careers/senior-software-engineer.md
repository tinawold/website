## About us

VIBBIO is a fast-growing tech startup, located in central Oslo. We’re building a marketplace, where businesses can order video production on-demand, directly from their user account. Our vision is to make smart video accessible, affordable and automatic. We are already working with big clients such as Microsoft, Visma, Aker BioMarine and Orkla

We’re a small team of four building the platform today. We take pride in our work, and aim to provide our customers with a delightful experience. We have the freedom to make our own decisions.

We work closely with our in-house team of video and content producers whose lives we want to make infinitely more enjoyable.

## Who we'e looking for

You have been around the block for a couple of years, probably worked at a couple of different places, and you have experience with a number of different technologies and languages, either from work or play.

You choose technology based on the task you need to accomplish rather than dogmatic beliefs. You are happiest on the backend but are comfortable with writing client-side Javascript. You have a thought or two on the upsides and downsides of different client-server-architectures

You are able to take on infrastructure tasks, and you take pride in lean solutions. You have experience with containerised applications or are eager to learn.

You don't have to be an expert in everything but we expect you to be able to research good solutions to the problems we decide to solve. We were thrilled if you had played with machine learning before, and had a knack for data-science.

But most importantly, you love to learn new things, and to dig deep when you're onto something.

## Problems to solve

Video production today consists of lots of repetitive manual tasks, and we strive to automate as much as possible of those. Areas we are looking at right now include captioning of interviews, facial recognition for automated placement of text overlays, and smart suggestions for cutting.

At least those are the ones we know about now.
