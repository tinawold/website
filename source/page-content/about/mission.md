## Why VIBBIO?

The way we communicate is changing. Video is quickly becoming one of the most important tools for companies to stand out online. However, video production is both expensive and time consuming – that’s why we started VIBBIO.

We recognised an urgent need for a new and better solution – and our mission is to make smart video **accessible, affordable and automatic**.

VIBBIO was founded 2016 in Oslo, Norway, by Marianne Bratt Ricketts and Stine Norum. In just over a year, the company has grown to a team of 14 employees.
