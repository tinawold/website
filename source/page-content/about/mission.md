## Fuelled by changing audience trends

Surrounded by technology-driven trends, changing how we live, learn and work – it has become imperative to stop "dozing in class".  But in so many ways, that's easier said than done..

Because, how will we manage to stay constantly updated - continually learning new things – with only limited time available in our already very busy lives?

Back in 2015, this situation got me thinking.
The answer could be found in new patterns emerging through how we spend our time online. We, as global audiences, are in fact hunting for knowledge. We're sifting through more content and much quicker than ever before, which again has resulted in research estimating our average concentration span to be of around a minute (in 2015). That might seem worrying, but to me it actually presented a hope - and an opportunity. I mean; Imagine - learning something new in a minute!

The key then, is how do you grab attention in a digitally crowded space?
And this is where video is unique. Humans are programmed to react to movement. And the power of video has clearly been confirmed by recent audience actions. Video has quickly become the most favoured, viewed and shared content type, wherever it is embedded or shown.

Based on this insight, we founded VIBBIO in early 2016 - naming it our mission to make video accessible, affordable and automatic.

Since then, we have gone on to work with many large brands and companies, creating hundreds of short, smart videos for use in marketing and communication. Latest, we've made all our know-how, tools and smarts available through our platform, making video planning and ordering accessible to companies everywhere.

So, two amazing years down the line, we have grown to a team of 14 - and this is only the beginning for VIBBIO.
